    <h2>
    HTML
    </h2>
    <h3>
    What is HTML?
    </h3>
    <p>
    It is the standard language for making websites, going from basic structure and content of a site.      
    </p>
    <h3>
    Explain the head and the body tags
    </h3>
    <p>
    The head tag is a tag reserved for all the meta data of the html, title of the site, and most things that a client won´t see.
    Body is the opposite, it includes all the text and content the user will see.     
    </p>
    <h3>
    Explain the section, article, aside, header, footer tag
    </h3>
    <p>
    Header serves as a tag for containing the introductory content in a section, such as a title and author in an article.
    Section is self explanatory, as it works as a divider for different sections of a document/website
    Article works as a complement for the section tag itself, since article is used for the actual content of an article
    Aside is indicatory of information that isn´t related or pertaining to the main content of the page/article
    Footer is saved for content that isn´t as important as the main text in a section. It is saved for contact info, authors, dates, in a common website this would be the "about us" section, with useful links
    </p>

    <h2>
    CSS
    </h2>
    <h3>
    What is CSS?
    </h3>
    <p>
    It is a language that defines, stylizes, and makes the content of an HTML presentable, changing things such as color, position of elements, etc. 
    </p>
    <h3>
    What is the purpose of CSS?
    </h3>
    <p>
    It serves the purpose of making HTML and XML files more comprehensive, prettier in a general sense, and even now adding things such as animations, all for UX. 
    </p>
    <h3>
    How do you apply a CSS to an HTML (explain the 3 options)
    </h3>
    <p>
    Inline, or basically adding the style elements inside an html element.
    Internal, which consists in making a mini .css document via the style tag in the head section of the document.
    External, which is the most practical for organization and cleanliness purposes. It involves just adding a link in the HTML to an external css file.
    </p>
    <h3>
    What is a selector? What is a CSS rule? 
    </h3>
    <p>
    A selector is how you identify which elements from an html file you want to apply the styles to. A rule is the combination of the selector list and its styles or declarations
    </p>
    <h3>
    Types of Selectors
    </h3>
    <p>
    Id selector uses the id element from an html component, and it uses # preceding the id name
    Class selector uses the class element, and it uses a dot (.) before the class name
    Tag selector just uses the tag name as an identifier in css.
    Tag and class selector works in conjunction, only affecting a certain class in a tag. It uses the tag name, followed by a dot and then the class name (div.name)
    </p>
    <h3>
    Class and ID    
    </h3>
    <p>
    Class is like an attribute, something to classify elements that share characteristics, while ID is a unique instance of something. This works with CSS to reutilize styles applied to an element, or make a unique case, whatever serves the situation
    </p>
    <h3>
    The Box Model
    </h3>
    <p>
    It refers to the layout of any one thing, or html element. The properties of this box, from inside to outside, are the content itself, the padding, border, and finally margin
    </p>
